Hi, I'm José María Pacheco, although I would rather be called Nay. I'm a biotechnician and bioinformatician currently exploring AI.

With extensive experience as a research scientist, I eagerly embrace new challenges. Constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and explore emerging technologies and tools, I am committed to delving deeply into the fascinating realm of data.
I’m currently learning and practicing with different Data Science tools, and I'm eager to find new projects to take on.
